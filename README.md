## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

### Android:
#### Add plugin:

You need to  add the necessary configurations to your   project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
  coresdk_plugin:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/JioMeet/JioMeetCoreTemplateSDK_Flutter.git
      ref: 0.0.7
```

#### Hilt:

To set up Hilt in your flutter project, follow these steps:

1. First, add the hilt-android-gradle-plugin plugin to your projectâ€™s root build.gradle file (**android/build.gradle**)

   ```gradle
   plugins {
   id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android") version "2.44" apply false
   }
   ```

2. Add the Hilt dependencies to the app-level build.gradle(**android/app/build.gradle**)

   ```gradle
   plugins {
     kotlin("kapt")
     id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android")
   }

   android {
       ...
       compileOptions {
           sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
           targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       }
   }

   dependencies {
           implementation "androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose:1.0.0"
           implementation "com.google.dagger:hilt-android:2.44"
           kapt "com.google.dagger:hilt-android-compiler:2.44"
   }
   ````

3. Create a Custom Application Class: If your users don't already have a custom Application class in their Android project, they should create one. This class will be used to initialize Hilt.

```kotlin
import android.app.Application;
import dagger.hilt.android.HiltAndroidApp;

@HiltAndroidApp
class MyApplication : Application {
    // ...
}
```

4. Modify AndroidManifest.xml: In the AndroidManifest.xml file of their app, users should specify the custom Application class they created as the application name. This tells Android to use their custom Application class when the app starts.

```xml
<application
    android:name=".MyApplication" <!-- Specify the name of your custom Application class -->
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
    <!-- ... -->
</application>
```

```swift

<string>Allow access to camera for meetings</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to mic for meetings</string>
```

### Enable Background Mode

###### Get you Jiomeet meeting id and pin

Use the [create meeting api](https://dev.jiomeet.com/docs/JioMeet%20Platform%20Server%20APIs/create-a-dynamic-meeting) to get your room id and password

### Usage

Here CoresdkPlugin is a main dart class to act as bridge between core tamplet sdk and FLutter client project. With _coresdkPlugin instance we can call the core tamplet SDK methods.

```dart  
final _jioCoreSdkPlugin = JioCoreSdkPlugin();
``` 

#### Join Meeting :
```dart   
try {
await _coresdkPlugin.launchMeetingCoreTemplateUi("meeting_id", "meeting_password", "meeting_title","pass bool value of isInitialAudioOn", "pass bool value of isInitialVideoOn");
} on PlatformException {
_meetingStatus = "error while joining";
}
```

#### Callbacks from plugin:

1 - Register methodchannel
```dart
static const platform = MethodChannel('coresdk_plugin');
```

2
```dart
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    coreSdkPluginCallbacks();
  }

  Future<void> coreSdkPluginCallbacks() async {
    platform.setMethodCallHandler((call) async {
      if (call.method == "meetingEnded") {
        setState(() {
          _meetingStatus = "Ended";
        });
      }
    });
  }
```

### Example
```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:coresdk_plugin/coresdk_plugin.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
   runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
   const MyApp({super.key});

   @override
   State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
   final _coresdkPlugin = JioCoreSdkPlugin();
   static const platform = MethodChannel('coresdk_plugin');
   String _meetingStatus = 'Not started';

   @override
   void initState() {
      super.initState();
      coreSdkPluginCallbacks();
   }

   Future<void> coreSdkPluginCallbacks() async {
      platform.setMethodCallHandler((call) async {
         if (call.method == "meetingEnded") {
            setState(() {
               _meetingStatus = "Ended";
            });
         }
      });
   }

   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(

            appBar: AppBar(

                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                     Text('meeting Status:  $_meetingStatus\n'),
                     TextButton(
                        onPressed: () async {
                           try {
                              await _coresdkPlugin.launchMeetingCoreTemplateUi(
                                      "meeting_id", "meeting_password", "meeting_title");
                           } on PlatformException {
                              _meetingStatus = "error while joining";
                           }
                        },
                        child: const Text('Join Meeting'),
